                This service is designed for students who are going to enroll in a particular university.
                The author himself went through a long and exhausting process of admission and choosing a
                university, direction and other things, so he wanted to create something that would help applicants.

                The project is in development, it was created with the help of pure enthusiasm.
                If you want to help us, write your suggestions about the work of the service and the addition
                of new cards, actively evaluate them and write detailed reviews. In the future, links to desktop
                and mobile applications will appear on this page (yes, their development is also in the plans).

                The author asks not to offend other users and to treat the work of administrators and the service as
                a whole with understanding, otherwise you may be blocked. We kindly ask you not to insult the teachers
                in the reviews of the cards, because we are all people. We also recommend that you write reviews only on
                those cards that you are directly related to (study at a certain university, studied with a teacher, etc.),
                otherwise there will be no point in this service.
